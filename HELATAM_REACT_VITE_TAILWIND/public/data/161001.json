    "It's been thousands of years since Prometheus stole the fire for humans. After being freed from the perpetual torture, Prometheus chose to settle in the mortal world. As humans developed thanks to fire, Prometheus sadly noticed that they also used fire to create weapons and destroy each other in wars. They would ruin the peace if let the behaviors continue, making Prometheusâ€™ gift of fire a great irony.<br>    While running around to settle disputes, Prometheus happened to know that Pandora left her Box of Doom in the war of deities. At the bottom of the box, Hope still remained. To free humans from the fever of war and bring civilization back to the mortal world, Prometheus had no other choice, but to betray deities again and steal the Spark of Hope."
