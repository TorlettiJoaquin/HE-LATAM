    "    Siren was a nightmare for all mariners. This violent Spirit of Storm could drive waves to roar on the sea.<br>    But everything changed after she picked up one baby. The cries of the baby provoked the motherhood of Siren who poured all her feelings into the baby. However, happiness didn't last long. The child got ill. It got a fatal illness that could not be cured in the mortal world. Siren turned to Poseidon and asked him for help, but the arrogant Poseidon ignored her request.<br>    Siren turned angry. Her anger flames burned the whole sea, and even the most valiant soldiers of Poseidon shivered in storm. Poseidon finally surrendered. He turned in a secret treasure of God which could save one life at the expense of another life.<br>    Siren used that secret treasure. The Spirit of Storm that ravaged the sea disappeared and the baby was found and adopted by a fisherman by the sea. Siren's solicitude for the child turned into the heart of magical sea and sank to the depth of the sea forever."
