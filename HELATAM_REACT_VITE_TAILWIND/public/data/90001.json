    "     The depths of his memory were covered with occult haze and could never be removed. The prophet told his ominous future at the time of his birth â€“ he and his brothers would kill their father, got bad repute and became the enemies of all people in the most tragic manner. This curse ran throughout his life like a haunting shadow. The father never hid his abomination of them and even wanted to get rid of them soon, but the mother hid them in the name of the earth. His childhood memories were all about hiding from place to place and surviving humbly.<br>     Titan wielded the heavy hammer in his hands, trying to expel the memories out of his mind. His father, the Great God Uranus, stood high in the sky and overlooked at him arrogantly. However, this reunion was not worth celebrating. He would rather cut off the disgusting relationship with his great father than carrying curses, living humbly and bearing baseless charges. The air was filled with smoke and blood. The disparity in power failed to break Titan's fighting spirit. His body got as dilapidated as the land under him, but he would never yield as long as he was able to fight again! Titan stood up again and again, keeping his body upright. He would never be defeated unless his head was cut off!<br>     Prophecy was finally realized in a horrifying way, but Titan laughed loudly.<br>     \"Come on!\" he muttered. \"I have seized my fate! I am fearless!\""
