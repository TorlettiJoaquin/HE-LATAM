    "     Come on, friends coming from afar, please come here, come to my home and sit for a while. I live in a despicable and utterly destitute cottage. Although I am also a fairy, I live in seclusion near the magic water, far away from the prosperous fairyland. I really don't have anything good to entertain you. Oops, you said that there must be something good in this food steamer? You really have flattered me, really... but I think you're sighted after all, so I seem to be mean if I continue to hide the truth from you.<br>     Uh~ I have delicious scented glutinous rice dumplings, do you want to have a taste?<br>     Wait! Let's come to an agreement at first. Don't spill the beans to other fairies of Penglai! If you let them know that this food steamer still exists in the world, then the peace scenario of Penglai will be destroyed at once... Don't laugh! Murry is a quite serious fairy otter! You eat your glutinous rice dumpling while let me talk with you so that you don't blame me for being mad.<br>     At that time, human beings destructed the rite and music system and smashed gods, which made the Royal Emperor of the supreme heaven bristle with anger and bring a series of heavy disasters to the human world. Therefore, violent social upheavals occurred and people suffered from the chaos caused by war and famine. The Royal Emperor cooled down forty-nine days later. He stood on the edge of Jade Mirror Pool and had a look at the human world. He could not help gaining compassion for humans. As one day in Heaven was equal to one year in the human world, the human world underwent disasters and people were plunged into dire suffering for forty-nine years over the past forty-nine days in Heaven. The Royal Emperor stopped heavenly disasters and then summoned an otter from the Jade Mirror Pool and ordered him to go to the human world with a steamer called \"Cloud Steamer\" and cook meals for people to end their famine suffering.<br>     After Murry came to the human world, it steamed rice with \"Cloud Steamer\" and added various ingredients. But it suddenly realized that there was no suitable container for distributing the food to people. Murry could not make people scoop and eat the food with a ladle around the \"Cloud Steamer\", could it? So Murry worked out a measure according to local conditions. It collected reed leaves by riverside and wrapped food with them for people to fill their stomach. Later generations named this kind of food as glutinous rice dumpling and the human custom of putting glutinous rice dumpling into water was not only commemoration but also gratitude to Heaven.<br>     Yes, I am the otter and this is that \"Cloud Steamer\". The people who ate glutinous rice dumplings got a part of faint fairy power. If their offspring were the only children, these offspring would inherit the gathered fairy power from their parents. These only children were the ancestors of the gods of Penglai. Please must not let them know that this fairy artifact is under their noses before they pledge allegiance to the supreme heaven.... Hey, don't be so nervous, otherwise glutinous rice dumpling is not tasteful. Don't worry, I am a fairy who once skied water in the Jade Mirror Pool! I also had a very good theurgy!"
