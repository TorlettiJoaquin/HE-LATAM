    "     Something unusual were bound to happen when the two mad scientists, Dr. Madd and Vince, met each other. They were connected by an old document which revealed a legendary story about the God of Chaos - Before fulfilling the ambition of unifying the continent, the God of Chaos disappeared from the world, leaving part of its power to form the Core of Chaos - Obviously, both of them were drooling at that powerful core.<br>     With common interests in black science, Dr. Madd and Vince entered into agreement soon. They tracked down the Core of Chaos at the ruins of the God's palace and finally managed to obtain it after exploding lots of acid bombs in front of the palace. In their laboratory, the mysterious core was integrated with genetic and mechanical technologies, taking a new shape of life named \"Omega\".<br>     However, before the two scientists celebrated the great success, Omega tore a big hole in the wall of the laboratory and escaped under their eyes. Neither Dr. Madd's mutant servants nor Vince's wind-up guardian could be a match for Omega who was equipped with multiple guns. After getting rid of its creators, the powerful experimental object started its journey on the unfamiliar land. Though feeling headless, it was guided by something in the deepest of its body to find the very edge of the continent. Omega was not aware that the destiny of whole world would be changed because of the journey which involved in the balance of light and darkness, as well as the tangles of past and future. The two scientists were still following Omega's footprints, while its real master was waiting in the throne far away. The adventure for Omega just begun."
