    "     One person wouldn't associate the name Zoe Claison with the Pathless Phantom no matter how imaginative the person was. Judging by appearance, Zoe Claison was only a fresh intern reporter carrying a little bear backpack and tracking all kinds of boring archaeological news all day long. In fact, however, Zoe Claison was an excellent treasure hunter and inborn adventurer. She had discovered or published countless archaeological sites.<br>     Under the cover of her reporter identity, she was able to travel more conveniently throughout the remains all over the world. In addition to acquiring treasures, she also had an ultimate goal: to find the remains of the Sacred Altar leading to the otherworld.<br>     One day, Zoe received a new mission â€“ a scientific expedition team had found a secret chamber guarded by two giant statues in the Mayan Pyramids amidst the American jungle and inside the secret chamber were reliefs decorated with the pattern of altar. \"This must be related to the remains of the Sacred Altar!\" Zoe got excited and hurriedly boarded one plane to the camp. She didn't bother herself to change her clothes and equipment.<br>     By virtue of the press card and vibrant smiles, she passed interrogation and examination easily, and then entered the scientific expedition camp. She secretly sneaked into the secret chamber at night after everyone fell asleep. When the chamber door was opened, moonlight fell onto the reliefs. A projection of the Sacred Altar with flickering blue light suddenly appeared in the chamber. Having noticed this sudden change, Zoe couldn't wait to take out her camera. But the moment she pressed down the shutter, the magical energy in the chamber began to boom and swallowed her in an instant.<br>     After waking up, Zoe found herself in a completely strange world: extremely beautiful and changeable sky colors, towering trees, and all kinds of strange creatures that she had never seen before.... And at the same time, the camera in her hand also had incredible changes and gained amazing magical energy.<br>     Looking at this unknown and dangerous world, Zoe stepped forward unhesitatingly because she realized that this adventure would be more interesting than ever before."
