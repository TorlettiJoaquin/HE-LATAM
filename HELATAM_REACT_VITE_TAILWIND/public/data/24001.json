    "     Sylvana, the Daughter of the Forest, was the only offspring left by Moon God in the world. She inherited powerful mana and a pure heart from her mother Moon God. Sylvana had been following the tree tender Wood and learning the laws of nature and attentive meditation since her childhood. After infinite days, the naughty Sylvana grew into a wise dryad leader and became the new forest guardian in replacement of the late Wood.<br>     When the Demon Legion invaded the continent and trampled on the life of people, Sylvana used the power of nature to resist invaders flexibly by virtue of the forest that she loved. Tough vines made it impossible for her opponents to move and all curses were useless in her eyes. Due to her activeness, intruders suffered heavy losses and chose to retreat. However, the evil fire and death that they left still swallowed the entire forest quickly. Sylvana sacrificed her life resolutely for the homeland that she loved, remedying the entire forest. She finally disappeared in the nectar under the moon, only leaving a jade cane for the people in the forest to shed tears and yearn for."
