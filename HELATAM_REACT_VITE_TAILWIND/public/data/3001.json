    "     No one knew why gods liked to place people under mountains. So many mountains looked like tombstones and once-free souls were placed under them. Maybe gods thought that the mountain never collapsed, but Yang Jian knew that there was no eternity. Sea could turn into farmland within an instant.<br>     As the immortal of law enforcement, Yang Jian had been wearing a cold mask. He held a two-blade and three-pointed halberd in his hand and mastered the mysterious nine-turning martial arts and seventy-three metamorphoses. He could turn into numerous things to sweep away all enemies and wipe out demons and monsters for Celestial Temple and the human world. However, the sky eye on his forehead had not opened for nearly five hundred years, perhaps because he was unwilling to see his younger sister Yang Chan and his buddy monkey trapped under mountain just like his mother in the past. Yang Jian resisted, but unfortunately, he failed. His fleshy body was destroyed. Only his primordial spirit remained and had to continue to follow the order of the Celestial Temple.<br>     The Sky Barking Hound was the only remaining partner of Yang Jian. This guy always looked up and barked at the heaven and the uncle of Yang Jian. Yang Jian was waiting in the small temple at the mouth of Guan River, waiting for the monkey to be set free and poke through the heaven together with him."
