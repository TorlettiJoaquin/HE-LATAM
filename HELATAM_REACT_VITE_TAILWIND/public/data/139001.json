    "     Most living creatures had to undergo the passage of time, but Glee Puck didn't fall into this category. As the essence of all natural things, Glee Puck had a clean and pure heart, a shape that never grew up and wonderful ability to communicate with flowers and animals. Her name came from her mantra: glee.<br>     After living alone in the nature for many years, she together with her little friend Clefairy came to a city-state of mankind out of the yearning for human world and desire for new friends. Glee Puck played with children and used magic to turn tables and chairs into flowers and animals temporarily for fun. But people didn't seem to appreciate her kindness. These adults quickly ordered their children to stay away from Glee Puck because of their fear of her magic and power.<br>     Glee Puck felt sad and left that city-state, aiming to find another new world full of goodness and beauty. When passing through the Valley of War, Glee Puck and Clefairy encountered the fierce beast Gluttony which was about to devour the nearest human city-state. Despite being alienated by humans, they fought a battle against Gluttony resolutely in order to protect the lovely children from being hurt. However, Gluttony was so powerful that Glee Puck and Clefairy were in danger. At the critical moment, a man called \"Fist\" from a different world appeared suddenly. With his help, Gluttony was finally defeated and retreated.<br>     Glee Puck developed strong interest in this man with a big dipper-shaped scar on his chest. In the face of this curious and innocent kiddy who raised questions one after another, Fist told her about his entire experience and his determination to sweep away all evilness and injustice. After listening to the narrative of Fist, Glee Puck felt the tremendous courage and the power of faith from his body. She realized that instead of looking for a visionary new world, it was better to create and guard all that she had at present. So she decided to become a partner of Fist and embarked on an unknown adventure together with him!<br>    I won't be afraid! Glee!<br>     â€“Glee Puck"
