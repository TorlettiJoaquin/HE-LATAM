For thousands of years, it witnessed wreak havoc of flames and the roaring of raging waves as well as the either noble or contemptible humanity that survived in the gap between these two forces. Gradually, its incomplete consciousness seemed to be complete, and it seemed to have gained a new life.<br>     Finally, it recovered enough power and its broken body was melted into a block.<br>     A body with enormous strength stood up slowly out of liquefied metal.<br>      \"From today on, I will be the new master on the battlefield!\"<br>      It swept all on the battlefield like a sharp blade falling from the sky. Its body was the most powerful weapon. A new elemental sprite had arrived and battlefield would change because of its arrival. It represented the strongest force among elemental planes and its name â€“ Sprite Auric â€“ would be engraved in everyone's mind!"
