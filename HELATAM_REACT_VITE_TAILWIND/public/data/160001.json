  "story": [
    "     Through the Spring of Wisdom, the Greater God foresaw tragic scenes of Ragnarok in which gods perished and the World Tree burned into ashes. Thus, the Greater God used aurora to create Heradias, titled as the Goddess of Battle. Different from Freya, Heradias was asked to incite wars among mortals and spread flames of war across Midgard. When Heradias scrubbed blood from her armor, it was time for Freya to guide the souls of the dead in wars to Valhalla. Everlasting wars were needed to stop the twilight of gods - that was what the Greater God said.<br>     As the arrival of Fimbulwinter, conflicts were frozen and those wars halted temporarily in Midgard. Nevertheless, the number of mortal beings died of cold and starvation were far greater than those killed in wars. The underworld was filled with ghosts of the innocent who were wandering in front of the Gate of Hell and suffering bitter cold. For such misery, Heradias' loyalty to the divine realm grew tangled. Heradias persuaded herself that the current misery of mortals would increase the gods' chance of winning against Ragnarok. If gods could survive, it must be easy for them to recover the mortal world. However, the illusion was completely shattered as she received the Greater God's order: Fimbulwinter was a warning of the coming of Regnarok, so more wars and more souls of warriors were needed to stop Regnarok at any cost, even sacrificing the entire Midgard.<br>     Countless mortals had been scorched by the flames of war, and more blood must be drained in the prolonged winter. Heradias came to realize she was an accomplice of the gods of Asgard who only cared about themselves in the massacre. It was be too late to regret, but there was still one thing she could do. She cut off the chain which shackled Fenrir. In face of the wolf who can devour everything, she closed the eyes with a smile while hearing crows of Gullinkambi and breaths of Jormungand.<br>     Heradias started the twilight of gods, but mortal beings got a chance to escape the net trap of fate placed by the gods."
