    "    When Crane was young, he and White Bear were the only two who passed severe trials of Master Turtle, the greatest Kungfu Master along River Jingxiu, and became his students.<br>    They competed with each other, but they were also close friends. Compared with impetuous Crane, Bear was given higher expectations by Master Turtle for his cautious and hardworking characteristics.<br>    Several years later when Crane entered the hall for his graduate exam, he found Master Turtle dying on the ground with blood all over him, and saw a white back in horror before he was stunned.<br>    Crane has grown to be a gentle master after experiencing the rebellion of his school. When noticing the invasion plan of the bear tribes in the north, Master Crane hit the road of adventure alone, looking into the death of his master."
