    "     The great High God was bothered by the appointment of his three sons on Mount Titans. Hades, Poseidon, and Zeus were all outstanding among gods and good options for governing the world. The High God found it difficult to make decisions.<br>     Hades was not worried at all. Thinking about his credits, he was confident that his father would choose him to be the human ruler. However, the partiality of the High God shattered the wish of Hades â€“ Zeus became the supreme ruler of the human world while Hades could only govern Netherworld and never have a chance to be with sunlight and moonlight.<br>     Hades felt disappointed and became colder and colder. He often rode nightmare bony horse on the edge of the Hades, holding a funeral sickle in his hand and staring at the touch of glimmer falling into Netherworld from the human world. \"That belongs to me!\" Hades yelled. He spent one thousand years in plotting and trying to defeat Zeus.<br>     Unfortunately, his conspiracy was seen through by Athena â€“the goddess of wisdom. Hades, who was trapped by Zeus, harvested the lives of besiegers with his funeral sickle. The blood of low-level gods and middle-level god was sprayed over the whole body of Hades and all the children of Zeus were also wounded. At this moment, Zeus finally ended the long ceremony and summoned \"Silencer of Thunder\" which chopped the sickle of Hades and crushed him completely..."
