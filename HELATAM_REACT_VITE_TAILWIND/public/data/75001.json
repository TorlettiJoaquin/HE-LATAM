    "     The eternal conflict between Heaven and Hell can be traced back to ancient times before human ancestors appeared. Through endless battles, the prophecy about the birth of the forbidden was spread around the world.<br>     He would become King of Evernight and also Son of Holiness, declaring his mission to end the eternal conflict. It was also firmly believed that his birth would bring doom upon Heaven and Hell.<br>     Unexpectedly, his birth was not a result of forbidden love across races but an extremely bloody battle. When a thousand angels fell and a thousand demons were destroyed, a human with angelic face and demonic body spread his enormous wings. The moment he appeared, a new world was formed out of chaos. Khaos, the pure primal god that contains the power of darkness and light, called himself the source of chaos and created humans.<br>     Humans flourished on the continent, but went to Heaven or Hell after death. Khaos got nothing in return and realized his power was stolen. Then, he rallied a massive human troop and initiated a battle against Heaven and Hell. Khaos was unstoppable and so close to the victory, but a human's betrayal at the critical moment made him sealed by Heaven and Hell together.<br>     Thousands of years after Khaos' failure, he broke the seal and returned to the world of mortals. With a wicked smile on his face, Khaos swore to reclaim his world and take back the control on the destiny of mortals."
