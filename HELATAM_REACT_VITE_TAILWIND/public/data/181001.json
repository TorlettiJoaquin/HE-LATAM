    "    In a remote village, a little boy named Prosper was believed to have the ability to bring good fortune and wealth, but he himself doubted that.<br>    Feeling bored of being enshrined and worshiped by people every day, Prosper attempted to escape from the shrine for outside world many times. Eventually, he gave up because of people's strong belief on him and himself being the last hope that kept them alive.<br>    When Prosper was about to comprise with his life in the shrine, a three-legged toad broke in suddenly and tried to take him away, revealing his previous life as a deity of wealth. The toad was aware of his hesitation and firmly believed that he was still the deity who treated others with kindness and generosity. After being enlightened by the toad, Prosper blew into the Bliss Jade and spitted out countless gold coins, fulfilling his promise to help the poor before leaving."
