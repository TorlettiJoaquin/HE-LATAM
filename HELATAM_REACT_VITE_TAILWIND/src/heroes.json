      "     No one knew why gods liked to place people under mountains. So many mountains looked like tombstones and once-free souls were placed under them. Maybe gods thought that the mountain never collapsed, but Yang Jian knew that there was no eternity. Sea could turn into farmland within an instant.<br>     As the immortal of law enforcement, Yang Jian had been wearing a cold mask. He held a two-blade and three-pointed halberd in his hand and mastered the mysterious nine-turning martial arts and seventy-three metamorphoses. He could turn into numerous things to sweep away all enemies and wipe out demons and monsters for Celestial Temple and the human world. However, the sky eye on his forehead had not opened for nearly five hundred years, perhaps because he was unwilling to see his younger sister Yang Chan and his buddy monkey trapped under mountain just like his mother in the past. Yang Jian resisted, but unfortunately, he failed. His fleshy body was destroyed. Only his primordial spirit remained and had to continue to follow the order of the Celestial Temple.<br>     The Sky Barking Hound was the only remaining partner of Yang Jian. This guy always looked up and barked at the heaven and the uncle of Yang Jian. Yang Jian was waiting in the small temple at the mouth of Guan River, waiting for the monkey to be set free and poke through the heaven together with him."

Sylvana had been following the tree tender Wood and learning the laws of nature and attentive meditation since her childhood. After infinite days, the naughty Sylvana grew into a wise dryad leader and became the new forest guardian in replacement of the late Wood.<br>     When the Demon Legion invaded the continent and trampled on the life of people, Sylvana used the power of nature to resist invaders flexibly by virtue of the forest that she loved. Tough vines made it impossible for her opponents to move and all curses were useless in her eyes. Due to her activeness, intruders suffered heavy losses and chose to retreat. However, the evil fire and death that they left still swallowed the entire forest quickly. Sylvana sacrificed her life resolutely for the homeland that she loved, remedying the entire forest. She finally disappeared in the nectar under the moon, only leaving a jade cane for the people in the forest to shed tears and yearn for."

      "     The eternal conflict between Heaven and Hell can be traced back to ancient times before human ancestors appeared. Through endless battles, the prophecy about the birth of the forbidden was spread around the world.<br>     He would become King of Evernight and also Son of Holiness, declaring his mission to end the eternal conflict. It was also firmly believed that his birth would bring doom upon Heaven and Hell.<br>     Unexpectedly, his birth was not a result of forbidden love across races but an extremely bloody battle. When a thousand angels fell and a thousand demons were destroyed, a human with angelic face and demonic body spread his enormous wings. The moment he appeared, a new world was formed out of chaos. Khaos, the pure primal god that contains the power of darkness and light, called himself the source of chaos and created humans.<br>     Humans flourished on the continent, but went to Heaven or Hell after death. Khaos got nothing in return and realized his power was stolen. Then, he rallied a massive human troop and initiated a battle against Heaven and Hell. Khaos was unstoppable and so close to the victory, but a human's betrayal at the critical moment made him sealed by Heaven and Hell together.<br>     Thousands of years after Khaos' failure, he broke the seal and returned to the world of mortals. With a wicked smile on his face, Khaos swore to reclaim his world and take back the control on the destiny of mortals."

      "     The depths of his memory were covered with occult haze and could never be removed. The prophet told his ominous future at the time of his birth â€“ he and his brothers would kill their father, got bad repute and became the enemies of all people in the most tragic manner. This curse ran throughout his life like a haunting shadow. The father never hid his abomination of them and even wanted to get rid of them soon, but the mother hid them in the name of the earth. His childhood memories were all about hiding from place to place and surviving humbly.<br>     Titan wielded the heavy hammer in his hands, trying to expel the memories out of his mind. His father, the Great God Uranus, stood high in the sky and overlooked at him arrogantly. However, this reunion was not worth celebrating. He would rather cut off the disgusting relationship with his great father than carrying curses, living humbly and bearing baseless charges. The air was filled with smoke and blood. The disparity in power failed to break Titan's fighting spirit. His body got as dilapidated as the land under him, but he would never yield as long as he was able to fight again! Titan stood up again and again, keeping his body upright. He would never be defeated unless his head was cut off!<br>     Prophecy was finally realized in a horrifying way, but Titan laughed loudly.<br>     \"Come on!\" he muttered. \"I have seized my fate! I am fearless!\""

In ancient Greek art, he is depicted as a handsome young man wearing a helmet and holding a spear."

      "     The coup against Empress Nina broke out on one night. The aristocrats who were once been forgiven rushed into the palace with soldiers. \"Catch Nina!\" Raging flame plagued the palace and illuminated cold corpses over the ground. \"Kill her. She is not worthy of empress!\"<br>     Targeted rebel army stroke all the way into her resting palace and Nina had to flee to the north side of the royal city with her guards. Beyond the north side was the dreadful Forbidden Forest. Rebel army would not be there. However, the gap between the strength of the two sides was too wide. When they arrived at the Forbidden Forest, all her guards had died in battle, leaving the desperate Nina alone encircled by her enemies.<br>The aristocrats sneered at her contemptuously, \"Do you want to surrender or escape into the land of death?\"<br>     The face of the empress got pale because of fear, but she still looked up and walked into the forest with dignity, \"I swear with my soul that I will come back! Kill all of you!\"<br>     The rebel army looked toward the dark forest riotously and wanted to confirm whether the empress was dead. Nina went into the depths of the thick forest and her feet got tied by cold sticky strings. The feeling of numbness spread from her limbs and violent chelicerae spread all over her body, harvesting her life little by little. The soul that was once arrogant fell into hell and death was coming. Nina shed tears desperately.<br>     \"I can't die...\" The anger of revenge rushed into her heart. The hatred of being betrayed and the pain of being gnawed made her yell hoarsely from the depths of her soul, \"I must not die!\"<br>     \"Do you want to revenge those people who had betrayed you?\" A sweet and tempting voice echoed near her ears suddenly. Nina replied resolutely, \"I want them to die in fear and pain!\"<br>     Darkness came from darker places. A huge human-faced tarantula emerged from the depths of a cave, watching the blurred vision of the severely injured empress and revealing a twisted and greedy smile.<br>     \"I like your hatred. I will give you the power that you desire if you knee under my feet!\" A few days later, the message that the empress re-ascended the throne shocked the whole kingdom. Civilians who loved Nina cheered and celebrated. Nobody knew that corpses wrapped by spidersâ€™ threads one by one were hung upside down from the dome of a large hall in the distant palace. The empress looked up coldly and the tarantula's minions were squatting behind her."

Judging by appearance, Zoe Claison was only a fresh intern reporter carrying a little bear backpack and tracking all kinds of boring archaeological news all day long. In fact, however, Zoe Claison was an excellent treasure hunter and inborn adventurer. She had discovered or published countless archaeological sites.<br>     Under the cover of her reporter identity, she was able to travel more conveniently throughout the remains all over the world. In addition to acquiring treasures, she also had an ultimate goal: to find the remains of the Sacred Altar leading to the otherworld.<br>     One day, Zoe received a new mission â€“ a scientific expedition team had found a secret chamber guarded by two giant statues in the Mayan Pyramids amidst the American jungle and inside the secret chamber were reliefs decorated with the pattern of altar. \"This must be related to the remains of the Sacred Altar!\" Zoe got excited and hurriedly boarded one plane to the camp. She didn't bother herself to change her clothes and equipment.<br>     By virtue of the press card and vibrant smiles, she passed interrogation and examination easily, and then entered the scientific expedition camp. She secretly sneaked into the secret chamber at night after everyone fell asleep. When the chamber door was opened, moonlight fell onto the reliefs. A projection of the Sacred Altar with flickering blue light suddenly appeared in the chamber. Having noticed this sudden change, Zoe couldn't wait to take out her camera. But the moment she pressed down the shutter, the magical energy in the chamber began to boom and swallowed her in an instant.<br>     After waking up, Zoe found herself in a completely strange world: extremely beautiful and changeable sky colors, towering trees, and all kinds of strange creatures that she had never seen before.... And at the same time, the camera in her hand also had incredible changes and gained amazing magical energy.<br>     Looking at this unknown and dangerous world, Zoe stepped forward unhesitatingly because she realized that this adventure would be more interesting than ever before."

      "     Most living creatures had to undergo the passage of time, but Glee Puck didn't fall into this category. As the essence of all natural things, Glee Puck had a clean and pure heart, a shape that never grew up and wonderful ability to communicate with flowers and animals. Her name came from her mantra: glee.<br>     After living alone in the nature for many years, she together with her little friend Clefairy came to a city-state of mankind out of the yearning for human world and desire for new friends. Glee Puck played with children and used magic to turn tables and chairs into flowers and animals temporarily for fun. But people didn't seem to appreciate her kindness. These adults quickly ordered their children to stay away from Glee Puck because of their fear of her magic and power.<br>     Glee Puck felt sad and left that city-state, aiming to find another new world full of goodness and beauty. When passing through the Valley of War, Glee Puck and Clefairy encountered the fierce beast Gluttony which was about to devour the nearest human city-state. Despite being alienated by humans, they fought a battle against Gluttony resolutely in order to protect the lovely children from being hurt. However, Gluttony was so powerful that Glee Puck and Clefairy were in danger. At the critical moment, a man called \"Fist\" from a different world appeared suddenly. With his help, Gluttony was finally defeated and retreated.<br>     Glee Puck developed strong interest in this man with a big dipper-shaped scar on his chest. In the face of this curious and innocent kiddy who raised questions one after another, Fist told her about his entire experience and his determination to sweep away all evilness and injustice. After listening to the narrative of Fist, Glee Puck felt the tremendous courage and the power of faith from his body. She realized that instead of looking for a visionary new world, it was better to create and guard all that she had at present. So she decided to become a partner of Fist and embarked on an unknown adventure together with him!<br>    I won't be afraid! Glee!<br>     â€“Glee Puck"

      "     Ying Zheng ate the fairy medicine brought back by Xu Fu on his east tour chariot at the age of forty-nine.<br>     The medicine had no taste, but made him drowsy immediately.<br>     Ying Zheng saw the three-year-old self in a small dim courtyard. The bustling sound of many children came from outside, but he never played with them. He needed to face his sullen father and frowning mother every day. He often wondered why the world was only as small as a courtyard and there were only so few people at home. But the young boy did not lose child's nature. He often threw things outside the courtyard. The children outside the courtyard began to notice his existence gradually. They threw back stones at him through an impenetrable wall.<br>     As time passed, the young Ying Zheng could even hit the children with stones just by voice outside the wall. Ying Zheng saw the forty-five-year-old self in extremely grand E-Pang Palace. His world was no longer the small courtyard in Handan but the entire land of China. However, this did not end the uneasiness of his inner heart. Behind his majesty was endless anxiety and uneasiness. In the end, he gave up restraint and degraded from a gentle monarch that treated worthy men with courtesy into a Tyrant Satt: building the Great Wall, abusing the financial resources of the people and burning books and burying Confucian scholars alive. Restraint, the one who could restrain the first emperor in the world was only himself. He knew fate and was about to die soon, but he tried to override time. The only thing that he cared about was to extend his life through theurgy and alchemy.<br>     At the moment that his consciousness finally dissipated in drowsiness, a voice full of vicissitudes asked him to make a choice between the two scenarios that he saw just now. There was a reason why Ying Zheng became the first emperor in the world. He answered hesitatingly:<br>     I want all!<br>     Then he finally conquered his last enemy: his dying life. He gained through theurgy the power comparable to Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors, resumed his childish appearance and came to a totally different world. Ying Zheng looked at that grotesque and gaudy new world. There was no suffocating courtyard or the fluttering flags of the great Qin Emperor.<br>     How could this be!<br>     He rode his own theurgy dragon chair and decided to take a good look at that world, and then swept the dukes in that world and incorporated the world into the territory of the great Qin Emperor. The world had a saying: Emperor Qin swept the world and watched over the world majestically; he waved his sword and cut off floating cloud, thus all the dukes/prince came westward to worship him. At this very moment, another small conqueror showed up in the world. Please show great respect when you come across him. Ying Zheng never showed mercy to those people who regard him as child. He would use ghost seal to smash them into pieces."

This ancient temple holds a lot of mysteries, including the peach tree that was over one hundred years old, but bearing neither leaves nor flowers. Everybody was talking about this weird tree, while the Elder of each generation persisted in taking care of it. In the warm spring, miracles happened. The tree prospered and bloomed insanely. Meanwhile, a baby was found crying on the peaches. The Elder came and took the baby without a word, leaving disciples astonished. Some people assured the baby was reincarnation of the Great Exorcist who sealed the Evil Lord a hundred years ago.<br>     The rumor was only half true. The Great Exorcist has been reincarnated, but only his body. His spirit has vanished. The Elder knew it clearly that the birth of this baby also marked the return of the Evil Lord 20 years later. Before that, he must pass on all his knowledge to this baby.<br>     At the age of eighteen, the peach boy was officially granted the Dharma name - Sunmonk - for his excellence in martial arts and Buddhism. At the same time, Sunmonk was told his past life as Great Exorcist and was destined to seal the Evil Lord by sacrificing himself again. He didn't say anything, but asked the Elder for a leave to travel for two years. After that, he would decide whether or not to fulfill his destiny. Great Exorcist has passed away, and he will live by his own decision as Sunmonk."

She hugged the arm of Naiad and swayed it gently, \"Naiad, Naiad, do we two really have to marry the same husband...\" \"Sun Ce is handsome, but he is called the Bully of Jiangdong. I'm afraid that he is not gentle and romantic...\" \"Naiad, isn't it very interesting if the flute of General Pyrrhus can be matched with our zither...\" Naiad patted on the hand of Lotus and said faintly, \"Later you go to the hall together with me. You don't say anything. Just let me handle all things.\"<br>     Sun Ce expressed his intention straightforward in the hall. Duke Qiao knew that he had no way out, but it was difficult for him to make a decision. He had been rushing around with his two daughters for decades in order to escape from the disaster of wars. He was not willing for his two daughters to get involved in wars, but they gradually demonstrated their extreme beauty and their prettiness was widely spread out, so they had to accept their destiny in the end. Noticing that Duke Qiao kept silent, Sun Ce got somewhat impatient. Pyrrhus saw this and opened his mouth. \"Duke Qiao and your two daughters have been homeless for so many years. Isn't it a joyful thing if Duke Wu can become your son-in-law?\"<br>     \"Pyrrhus hits the mark with a single comment. How do you know it's joyful? You seem to understand us two sisters better than Duke Wuâ€”\" Someone said lightly. The voice sounded like a jade falling into an ice pool and even the splash of water was cold.<br>     Sun Ce and Pyrrhus turned back and looked toward the hall parlor. The soldiers crowding the front hall dispersed unconsciously. Two women came over slowly, one in the front and the other one in the back. The woman who spoke just now walked in the front and raised her head slightly with her hair top-knotted and inserted with a phoenix-like spiral feather. She had tall figure and well-proportioned eyes. When she walked, the golden phoenix-like spiral feather and the pendent between her eyebrows wobbled rhythmically. Her clothing was elegant with winding cuffs from the ground and a long skirt tail dragged behind her body. She was as light as water but as noble as a phoenix. She overlooked at Pyrrhus like a monarch overlooked the whole world, \"Why doesn't Pyrrhus propose marriage? Is it because that you look down upon Naiad and Lotus because of our Sinister Prisoner identity?\"<br>     Pyrrhus realized that what he said just now was impolite and was about to say something. But Naiad ignored him and turned over to Sun Ce and bowed slightly, \"Duke Wu, I beg your forgiveness. My father feels awkward because he worries,\" Naiad pulled Lotus to her side. \"We two sisters are always close with each other, but it's inevitable that we will gradually become alienated from each other if we serve the same husband. My father and we two sisters are not willing to see this.\" Having seen that Sun Ce seemed to be absorbed in thought, Naiad continued, \"I heard that Duke Wu has always been kind to talented people and he treated Pyrrhus like his own brother. Duke Wu, you two people propose marriage together. Two talents match two beauties respectively. Both sisterhood and brotherhood are respected in this way. Isn't this a perfect idea?\"<br>     \"Ha-ha, what a perfect idea! Ah, Pyrrhus, you have good luck today. Ehâ€”\" Sun Ce looked at Naiad with great interest. \"Would you marry me or your younger sister married me?\" Naiad couldn't help smiling. Her smile agitated the heart of Sun Ce. \"Duke Wu is joking. I never say that I'm the elder sister. Lotus thinks it's an ancient ritual to respect for seniority. As Duke Wu is elder than Pyrrhus, so Duke Wu should match with the elder sister and I match with Pyrrhus.\" Naiad then pushed Lotus to the side of Sun Ce gently. Sun Ce was in a hurry and yelled that this was improper. Lotus tittered and felt at ease after catching a glimpse of her elder sister. She knew that her elder sister would always protected her.<br>     After marriage was nailed down, Sun Ce responded to the request of Naiad: treating the whole members of Qiao family well. Naiad then re-introduced herself the elder sister. Sun Ce was not angry or annoyed. He smiled and looked Naiad, thinking that he really could not see through this wife. A long time later, Sun Ce asked Naiad what she would do if he agreed with her matching proposal of respecting the seniority at that time.<br>     \"This shows that you are a person who abides by etiquette, then you mean what you say in terms of big issues. After you know the truth and find that I'm elder, then you will still marry me. You chose to follow your heart at that time.\" Naiad then looked back at Sun Ce with a smile, looking like a phoenix falling into the human world. The eyes of Sun Ce were blinkered. He really wanted to ask her, \"What is really in her mind? Did she just want to help Lotus?\" But he hesitated and didn't dare to open his mouth."

      "     Come on, friends coming from afar, please come here, come to my home and sit for a while. I live in a despicable and utterly destitute cottage. Although I am also a fairy, I live in seclusion near the magic water, far away from the prosperous fairyland. I really don't have anything good to entertain you. Oops, you said that there must be something good in this food steamer? You really have flattered me, really... but I think you're sighted after all, so I seem to be mean if I continue to hide the truth from you.<br>     Uh~ I have delicious scented glutinous rice dumplings, do you want to have a taste?<br>     Wait! Let's come to an agreement at first. Don't spill the beans to other fairies of Penglai! If you let them know that this food steamer still exists in the world, then the peace scenario of Penglai will be destroyed at once... Don't laugh! Murry is a quite serious fairy otter! You eat your glutinous rice dumpling while let me talk with you so that you don't blame me for being mad.<br>     At that time, human beings destructed the rite and music system and smashed gods, which made the Royal Emperor of the supreme heaven bristle with anger and bring a series of heavy disasters to the human world. Therefore, violent social upheavals occurred and people suffered from the chaos caused by war and famine. The Royal Emperor cooled down forty-nine days later. He stood on the edge of Jade Mirror Pool and had a look at the human world. He could not help gaining compassion for humans. As one day in Heaven was equal to one year in the human world, the human world underwent disasters and people were plunged into dire suffering for forty-nine years over the past forty-nine days in Heaven. The Royal Emperor stopped heavenly disasters and then summoned an otter from the Jade Mirror Pool and ordered him to go to the human world with a steamer called \"Cloud Steamer\" and cook meals for people to end their famine suffering.<br>     After Murry came to the human world, it steamed rice with \"Cloud Steamer\" and added various ingredients. But it suddenly realized that there was no suitable container for distributing the food to people. Murry could not make people scoop and eat the food with a ladle around the \"Cloud Steamer\", could it? So Murry worked out a measure according to local conditions. It collected reed leaves by riverside and wrapped food with them for people to fill their stomach. Later generations named this kind of food as glutinous rice dumpling and the human custom of putting glutinous rice dumpling into water was not only commemoration but also gratitude to Heaven.<br>     Yes, I am the otter and this is that \"Cloud Steamer\". The people who ate glutinous rice dumplings got a part of faint fairy power. If their offspring were the only children, these offspring would inherit the gathered fairy power from their parents. These only children were the ancestors of the gods of Penglai. Please must not let them know that this fairy artifact is under their noses before they pledge allegiance to the supreme heaven.... Hey, don't be so nervous, otherwise glutinous rice dumpling is not tasteful. Don't worry, I am a fairy who once skied water in the Jade Mirror Pool! I also had a very good theurgy!"

      "     Through the Spring of Wisdom, the Greater God foresaw tragic scenes of Ragnarok in which gods perished and the World Tree burned into ashes. Thus, the Greater God used aurora to create Heradias, titled as the Goddess of Battle. Different from Freya, Heradias was asked to incite wars among mortals and spread flames of war across Midgard. When Heradias scrubbed blood from her armor, it was time for Freya to guide the souls of the dead in wars to Valhalla. Everlasting wars were needed to stop the twilight of gods - that was what the Greater God said.<br>     As the arrival of Fimbulwinter, conflicts were frozen and those wars halted temporarily in Midgard. Nevertheless, the number of mortal beings died of cold and starvation were far greater than those killed in wars. The underworld was filled with ghosts of the innocent who were wandering in front of the Gate of Hell and suffering bitter cold. For such misery, Heradias' loyalty to the divine realm grew tangled. Heradias persuaded herself that the current misery of mortals would increase the gods' chance of winning against Ragnarok. If gods could survive, it must be easy for them to recover the mortal world. However, the illusion was completely shattered as she received the Greater God's order: Fimbulwinter was a warning of the coming of Regnarok, so more wars and more souls of warriors were needed to stop Regnarok at any cost, even sacrificing the entire Midgard.<br>     Countless mortals had been scorched by the flames of war, and more blood must be drained in the prolonged winter. Heradias came to realize she was an accomplice of the gods of Asgard who only cared about themselves in the massacre. It was be too late to regret, but there was still one thing she could do. She cut off the chain which shackled Fenrir. In face of the wolf who can devour everything, she closed the eyes with a smile while hearing crows of Gullinkambi and breaths of Jormungand.<br>     Heradias started the twilight of gods, but mortal beings got a chance to escape the net trap of fate placed by the gods."

They would ruin the peace if let the behaviors continue, making Prometheusâ€™ gift of fire a great irony.<br>    While running around to settle disputes, Prometheus happened to know that Pandora left her Box of Doom in the war of deities. At the bottom of the box, Hope still remained. To free humans from the fever of war and bring civilization back to the mortal world, Prometheus had no other choice, but to betray deities again and steal the Spark of Hope."

      "     She had no name back then; people simply knew her as the fan vendor on the streets of a small town. Her small figure huddled behind the stall, embroidering fan surfaces. Let's call her \"Little Fan\". During the day, Little Fan embroidered flowers and birds, selling a few fans. At night, she used the money to buy incense and offer prayers to the Buddha with unwavering devotion. The Buddha was moved by her sincerity and watched over her from the heavens, cherishing her like a small flower in the palm of his hand.<br>     The small town was peaceful and prosperous, its residents living in harmony and love. But calamity is blind; a predestined mountain fire swept through the entire town. The Buddha couldn't bear to see his devotee, Little Fan, suffer from this disaster. He revealed his divine form, intending to persuade her to leave and ensure her survival.<br>     However, Little Fan knelt down and refused to leave. She had been abandoned as an infant by her biological parents, but the kind-hearted townspeople took her in. Each family nurtured and educated her as their own. Though they had no blood relation, they were already like family, and the small town was her home. She couldn't abandon her loved ones to their fate and fled alone. Little Fan implored the Buddha to withdraw the mountain fire, willingly enduring torment in this life without hesitation.<br>     Moved by Little Fan's plea, the Buddha sighed lightly and granted her request. But he also reminded her that tampering with destiny was a grave taboo in the celestial realm. The alteration of fate for the small town came at the cost of Little Fan's merits and life in this lifetime, and it was a one-time occurrence. Grateful tears streamed down Little Fan's face, and she readily agreed. She burned herself in the Samadhi True Fire, using her own flesh to shield the townspeople from the catastrophe.<br>     Reborn from the flames, Little Fan attained enlightenment and became an immortal due to her sacrifice for the lives of many. The townspeople were grateful for her salvation and built hundreds of temples in her honor. She watched over the townspeople, rejoicing in their newfound life. Even as an immortal, she continued to protect them in the heaven.<br>     Yet, at that time, the little celestial being had no awareness that destined calamity cannot be avoided. Who could have anticipated that a hundred years later, a mischievous monkey would intrude upon the celestial realm, causing havoc and toppling the alchemy furnace of the Lord Lao Zi? The Samadhi True Fire raged unceasingly, scorching the desert, mountains, and even engulfing Little Fan's hometown in flames. She watched from above as her family members fled in panic, consumed by flames. Her heart raced, but she was helpless. She remembered the warning the Buddha had given her when she became an immortal - she must not violate the heavenly laws or interfere in the mortal realm; otherwise, it would result in perpetual punishment.<br>     Seeing the flames closing in on her own robes, the infant in swaddling clothes choking on the thick smoke, Little Fan could no longer remain idle. She pulled out fan after fan, using them to fan the flames from the sky to the ground. She replaced a broken fan with another in an endless cycle, until calluses formed on her hands and rivers of sweat flowed ceaselessly. Finally, she even broke into the treasure room of the Lord Lao Zi, toppling the servant boys, and stole the Heaven Fan capable of extinguishing all things. She risked her life to fan the flames downward...<br>     The fire in the small town finally extinguished, and the entire town was saved once again by her. However, despite her merits in saving lives, she had forcibly taken a divine treasure, harmed her celestial friends, and violated heavenly laws. As punishment, she was condemned to endure perpetual torment at the Flame Mountain, nurturing the scorched and tattered Heaven Fan with her immortal power, forever unable to step outside even one foot.<br>     With the crippled Heaven Fan in her possession, Little Fan descended into the depths of the Flame Mountain. The yellow sand filled the air, and there were scarce traces of smoke, even the small demons on the desert enduring hunger and thirst. Being inherently kind-hearted, Little Fan used her magic to summon water sources and vegetation, erecting shaded earthen houses. Finally, she took up the Heaven Fan and tried to fan the flames of the Flame Mountain smaller - remarkably, she succeeded. Countless demons and humans flocked to her, settling in the shelter she provided, living in harmony as if in a utopia. The residents of the Flame Mountain revered her as Princess Fay, a title she accepted with a smile.<br>     During the day, Fay engaged in banter with them, but when the moonlight filled the desert, she sat alone on the dunes, gazing southward. South of the desert was her longed-for hometown and family."

They were connected by an old document which revealed a legendary story about the God of Chaos - Before fulfilling the ambition of unifying the continent, the God of Chaos disappeared from the world, leaving part of its power to form the Core of Chaos - Obviously, both of them were drooling at that powerful core.<br>     With common interests in black science, Dr. Madd and Vince entered into agreement soon. They tracked down the Core of Chaos at the ruins of the God's palace and finally managed to obtain it after exploding lots of acid bombs in front of the palace. In their laboratory, the mysterious core was integrated with genetic and mechanical technologies, taking a new shape of life named \"Omega\".<br>     However, before the two scientists celebrated the great success, Omega tore a big hole in the wall of the laboratory and escaped under their eyes. Neither Dr. Madd's mutant servants nor Vince's wind-up guardian could be a match for Omega who was equipped with multiple guns. After getting rid of its creators, the powerful experimental object started its journey on the unfamiliar land. Though feeling headless, it was guided by something in the deepest of its body to find the very edge of the continent. Omega was not aware that the destiny of whole world would be changed because of the journey which involved in the balance of light and darkness, as well as the tangles of past and future. The two scientists were still following Omega's footprints, while its real master was waiting in the throne far away. The adventure for Omega just begun."

The cries of the baby provoked the motherhood of Siren who poured all her feelings into the baby. However, happiness didn't last long. The child got ill. It got a fatal illness that could not be cured in the mortal world. Siren turned to Poseidon and asked him for help, but the arrogant Poseidon ignored her request.<br>    Siren turned angry. Her anger flames burned the whole sea, and even the most valiant soldiers of Poseidon shivered in storm. Poseidon finally surrendered. He turned in a secret treasure of God which could save one life at the expense of another life.<br>    Siren used that secret treasure. The Spirit of Storm that ravaged the sea disappeared and the baby was found and adopted by a fisherman by the sea. Siren's solicitude for the child turned into the heart of magical sea and sank to the depth of the sea forever."
