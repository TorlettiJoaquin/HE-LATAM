    "Parents' arms were the safest harbor to their children, but Naya hadn't seen her father for a long time. Every time she asked where her father was, she was comforted and told that her father was on a trip around the world. However, her father failed to return home year after year. Naya couldn't wait any more.<br>    One day, she went to the sea and set sail for her father, but a terrific sea storm came and capsized her small boat. While struggling, Naya saw her father stretching out his hands to her from the sky. Then, she saw a colorful feather floating on the waves. Fortunately, the feather saved her by granting her a pair of red wings.<br>    Since then, whenever the waves roared, the winged girl carried twigs and pebbles from mountains to suppress the raging waves."
