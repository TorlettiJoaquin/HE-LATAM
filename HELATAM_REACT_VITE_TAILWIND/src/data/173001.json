    "Welcome to the treasury of Nazarick! I'm Pandora Jackert, the treasury's guardian and also the chief of the Forty-One Supreme Beings. For you're here now, you must have fought against other guardians created by Lord Aniz. If you judge me by experience and treat me as a funny clown, you're completely wrong. Pandora Jackert is not good at boasting, but is undoubtedly the most important force of the great tomb as well as the ultimate weapon of Nazarick. My shapeshift ability allows me to substitute any of the guardians when necessary. Pandora Jackert is turned out to be an all-rounder. Yeah, ALL-ROUNDER. Uh-oh, since you've stretched out the weapon, I'm afraid I can't continue the self-introduction. If you're determined to enter the treasury, I can only do one thing. Take your life at the gate."
