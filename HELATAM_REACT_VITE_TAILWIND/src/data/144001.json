    "     Do human beings have free will to choose between right and wrong? To find the truth, monks in the Sky Temple are dedicated to both mental and physical training. This ancient temple holds a lot of mysteries, including the peach tree that was over one hundred years old, but bearing neither leaves nor flowers. Everybody was talking about this weird tree, while the Elder of each generation persisted in taking care of it. In the warm spring, miracles happened. The tree prospered and bloomed insanely. Meanwhile, a baby was found crying on the peaches. The Elder came and took the baby without a word, leaving disciples astonished. Some people assured the baby was reincarnation of the Great Exorcist who sealed the Evil Lord a hundred years ago.<br>     The rumor was only half true. The Great Exorcist has been reincarnated, but only his body. His spirit has vanished. The Elder knew it clearly that the birth of this baby also marked the return of the Evil Lord 20 years later. Before that, he must pass on all his knowledge to this baby.<br>     At the age of eighteen, the peach boy was officially granted the Dharma name - Sunmonk - for his excellence in martial arts and Buddhism. At the same time, Sunmonk was told his past life as Great Exorcist and was destined to seal the Evil Lord by sacrificing himself again. He didn't say anything, but asked the Elder for a leave to travel for two years. After that, he would decide whether or not to fulfill his destiny. Great Exorcist has passed away, and he will live by his own decision as Sunmonk."
