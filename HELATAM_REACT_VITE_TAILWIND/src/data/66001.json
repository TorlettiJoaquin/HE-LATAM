    "     \"I will conquer the land I see with my lifelong power; I come, I see and I conquer!\"<br>     The emperor said so. He took up the Eternal Sword and the people acknowledged allegiance to him where his sword pointed at â€“ This was Caesar, the most beloved son of the gods. The elegant and sacred white lion Theuth came to our emperor from the mountain of gods. It brought the holy shrine from the gods: only the great emperor was the real king in this world! No one could stop the army led by him. The resolution that he made led us to the top of glory.<br>     He was the strongest warrior. He set the eternal cornerstone for the sacred Roman Empire. When everything was over, he gave up his honor as a great emperor.<br>     He and the sacred beast Theuth left quietly under sacred sunglow. The mountain of god was his upcoming destination. He would be the god who always covered Rome with divine light â€“ the king of eternity, the great emperor Caesar, Julius!"
